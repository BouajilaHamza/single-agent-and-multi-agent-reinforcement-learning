# Reinforcement Learning Study Plan Assessment

## Notes
- The project directory exists and contains a README.md, main.py, Q_table.npy, and relevant folders.
- README.md provides strong conceptual documentation on single-agent and multi-agent RL, including definitions, challenges, algorithms, and a comparison table.
- main.py currently only prints a greeting; no RL environment code or experiments are implemented yet.
- No evidence (yet) of running/tweaking a PettingZoo environment or documenting those experiments.
- The study plan for Week 1 includes running a PettingZoo environment and documenting changes in a GitHub repo.

## Task List
- [x] Create project directory and initialize documentation (README.md)
- [x] Document single-agent and multi-agent RL theory in README.md

### Single-Agent RL
- [ ] Implement a basic single-agent environment (e.g., CartPole, LunarLander)
- [ ] Train a PPO agent using Stable Baselines3
- [ ] Evaluate and document the agent's performance
- [ ] Tweak hyperparameters and document observations

### Multi-Agent RL
- [ ] Implement a PettingZoo environment (e.g., pistonball, simple_spread)
- [ ] Train agents using a multi-agent algorithm
- [ ] Evaluate and document the agents' performance
- [ ] Tweak environment or agent parameters and record observations

### Documentation & Next Steps
- [ ] Document all code changes, experiments, and findings
- [ ] Summarize lessons learned and next steps for future work

## Current Goal
Implement and run a PettingZoo environment
