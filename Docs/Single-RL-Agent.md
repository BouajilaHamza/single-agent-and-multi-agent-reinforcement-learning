# 🧠 Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning — Deep Dive

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for learning **how to act** in an environment to **maximize long-term rewards**. The agent learns by trial and error, interacting with its environment.

## 🔹 1. Key Components in Single-Agent RL

Let’s define and explain the **fundamental components** of an RL system:

| Component                   | Definition                                                        | Role                                                 | Why It Matters                                        | Intuition                                         |                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Agent**                   | The learner or decision-maker                                     | Chooses actions to take                              | It's the system we’re training                        | Think of a robot or AI player                     |                                      |
| **Environment**             | The world the agent interacts with                                | Responds to the agent’s actions and returns feedback | It's what defines the task                            | Like a game, world, or simulation                 |                                      |
| **State (s)**               | A representation of the current situation                         | Input to the agent’s policy                          | Encodes everything the agent needs to make a decision | Like the current screen in a game                 |                                      |
| **Action (a)**              | A choice made by the agent                                        | Changes the environment state                        | Drives learning through consequences                  | Like moving left/right, jumping                   |                                      |
| **Reward (r)**              | A scalar feedback signal                                          | Tells the agent how good an action was               | Basis for learning behavior                           | Like score or penalty                             |                                      |
| **Policy (π)**              | A mapping from states to actions (π(a)/s)                                                 | Determines the agent’s behavior                       | Core object to optimize                           | Like the agent’s "brain" or instinct |
| **Value Function (V or Q)** | Estimates expected future rewards                                 | Helps evaluate actions or states                     | Guides improvement of the policy                      | Like predicting how good the current state is     |                                      |
| **Transition Function (T)** | Probability of moving to a new state given current state & action | Describes how the environment works                  | Helps in planning (in model-based RL)                 | Like knowing rules of the world                   |                                      |
| **Discount Factor (γ)**     | Determines importance of future rewards                           | Balances short-term vs. long-term rewards            | Encourages long-term planning                         | Like valuing future money less than present money |                                      |

## 🔹 2. Markov Decision Process (MDP)

### 📌 Formal Definition:

An MDP is a 5-tuple:

$$
\text{MDP} = (S, A, T, R, \gamma)
$$

Where:

* $S$: Set of **states**
* $A$: Set of **actions**
* $T(s' | s, a)$: **Transition function**, probability of going to state $s'$ from state $s$ after taking action $a$
* $R(s, a)$: **Reward function**, expected immediate reward for taking action $a$ in state $s$
* $\gamma \in [0,1]$: **Discount factor**, controls future reward importance

### 🎯 Why MDP?

It provides a **mathematical framework** to model decision-making problems under uncertainty and delayed consequences.

### 💡 Markov Property:

The next state depends **only** on the current state and action:

$$
P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t, s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, ...) = P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)
$$

This simplifies learning by making **only the current state** relevant for decisions.

---

## 🔹 3. The Policy (π)

### 📌 Definition:

A **policy** is a function:

* Deterministic: $\pi(s) = a$
* Stochastic: $\pi(a|s) = P(a \mid s)$

### 🎯 Role:

The policy tells the agent **what to do** in each situation.

### 🧠 Intuition:

Imagine an internal compass that guides actions — **the policy is the learned strategy**.

### 📍 Why Important?

It's the **core object we optimize**. A good policy consistently picks actions that lead to **high future rewards**.

---

## 🔹 4. Reward (r)

### 📌 Definition:

A scalar signal $r_t \in \mathbb{R}$ received after each action.

### 🎯 Role:

Rewards **guide learning** by telling the agent how good or bad an action was.

### 🧠 Intuition:

A reward is like **applause or punishment** — it provides feedback on behavior.

### 📍 Why Important?

Without reward, there’s no reason to learn. It's the **training signal** for improvement.

---

## 🔹 5. Value Functions

These help the agent understand **how good** things are, based on expected future rewards.

### A. **State Value Function** $V^\pi(s)$

$$
V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \mid s_0 = s \right]
$$

* Expected return starting from state $s$, following policy $\pi$

### B. **Action-Value Function** $Q^\pi(s, a)$

$$
Q^\pi(s,a) = \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \mid s_0 = s, a_0 = a \right]
$$

* Expected return from taking action $a$ in state $s$, then following policy

### 🎯 Role:

Value functions **evaluate** the quality of states or actions.

### 🧠 Intuition:

Imagine estimating how good it is to be in a certain state or take a certain action — like forecasting reward.

### 📍 Why Important?

They guide **policy improvement** and **planning**.

---

## 🔹 6. The Discount Factor (γ)

### 📌 Definition:

A number $\gamma \in [0, 1)$ that reduces the weight of future rewards.

### 🎯 Role:

Balances the importance of **immediate vs. future** rewards.

### 🧠 Intuition:

People prefer rewards now over rewards later — the discount factor models this bias.

### 📍 Why Important?

Encourages long-term planning. Without it ($\gamma = 0$), the agent is greedy.

---

## 🔹 7. Learning Objectives

The agent wants to **maximize the expected return**:

$$
\max_\pi \mathbb{E}_\pi \left[ \sum_{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_t \right]
$$

This is done by **improving the policy** over time, using techniques like:

* **Value Iteration**
* **Policy Iteration**
* **Q-Learning**
* **Policy Gradient**

---

## 🔹 8. Intuition: The Learning Loop

Here's how the pieces work together:

1. **Agent observes state** $s$
2. **Policy picks action** $a = \pi(s)$
3. **Environment returns** next state $s'$ and reward $r$
4. **Agent updates** its policy/value estimates using reward
5. Repeat

This is called the **reinforcement learning loop**.

## 🔹 9. Real-World Example: Robot Navigation

| Component | Example                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| State     | Robot’s (x, y) location                     |
| Action    | Move up/down/left/right                     |
| Reward    | +1 for reaching goal, -0.1 per move         |
| Policy    | Map from (x, y) to best direction           |
| Value     | Estimate of how close a location is to goal |

Over time, the robot learns a policy that minimizes steps to goal — **without being explicitly told how**.
